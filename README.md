# AI-Powered E-commerce Returns Agent

This project is a sophisticated, AI-powered chatbot designed to fully automate the customer returns process for e-commerce platforms like Shopify. It functions as an autonomous agent that handles customer return requests from start to finish through an embeddable web chat widget.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Conversational AI:** Customers use natural language to initiate and process returns.
- **Automated Order Verification:** Connects to the Shopify API to look up and verify order details.
- **Dynamic Policy Enforcement:** Checks return eligibility against configurable store policies (e.g., 30-day return window).
- **End-to-End Processing:** Capable of processing refunds directly through the Shopify API.
- **Web Integration:** Includes a self-contained frontend widget that can be embedded into any online store.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- A Shopify store with Admin API access
- An OpenAI API key

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopify-returns-chat-agent.git
    cd shopify-returns-chat-agent
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # For development, install the testing dependencies as well:
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

### 3. Configuration

1.  **Create an environment file** by copying the example:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Edit the `.env` file** with your credentials:
    ```env
    # Required: Shopify Admin API credentials
    SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN="shpat_your_actual_token_here"
    SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN="your-store.myshopify.com"

    # Required: OpenAI API credentials
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your_actual_openai_key_here"

    # Optional: Sentry for error monitoring
    SENTRY_DSN=""
    ```

### 4. Running the Application

The application can be run in two ways:

1.  **As a CLI Chatbot (for testing):**
    ```bash
    python scripts/llm_chat.py
    ```

2.  **As a Web Service (for web widget integration):**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    You can then access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.
